For my project I decided to use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.I chose JSon because of its difficulty at least it was more difficulty when I first tested it. Its a website made for fetching information.Perfect for API testing. I basically just fetched different pieces of information to prove Testing and coding knowledge. I took a simple route basically the main commands first, then a HTTP request and a test with errors in the CSS and assertion.(For Restfulbooker and Ping Healthcheck.....) The purpose of these tests and pull request is to show where my skill lies in Automation testing and github fundamentals. My testing approach utilizes Authorization, Javascrypt syntax basics, and Cypress Automation all in one. You may need a token from the restfullbooker site to run test also checking the api with the get method to find the id you should use would help to.
